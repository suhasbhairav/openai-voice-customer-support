## Executive Overview

OpenAI Voice Customer Support is designed for builders who need more than a static UI kit. It provides a concrete application pattern with a Next.js frontend, server-side API route, environment-driven provider configuration, and a responsive interface that can be adapted into a SaaS product, internal workflow, customer-facing assistant, or AI operations tool.

This template is intentionally structured so product teams can evaluate the interaction model quickly, then harden the implementation with authentication, persistence, monitoring, rate limits, and organization-specific business logic.

Responsive result surface

## Project Structure

- `app/page.js`
- `app/layout.js`
- `app/globals.css`
- `app/api`

## API Surface

| Route | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `/api/realtime-token` | Creates a server-side ephemeral Realtime session token. |

## Output Contract

```json
{
  "demo": false,
  "model": "gpt-realtime",
  "clientSecret": "...",
  "output": "Realtime client secret created."
}
```

## Quick Start

```bash
cp .env.example .env.local
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open the app:

```text
http://localhost:3000
```

If port 3000 is already in use:

```bash
npm run dev -- -p 3001
```

## Environment Variables

| Variable | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `OPENAI_API_KEY` | Yes | Used server-side to call OpenAI. |
| `OPENAI_REALTIME_MODEL` | No | Optional model override for OpenAI Realtime sessions. |

## Implementation Notes

- Keep all provider API keys inside server-only routes.
- Treat the UI as a product workbench, not a throwaway demo screen.
- Add durable storage only after the core workflow is validated.
- Keep prompts, model choices, and tool calls auditable.
- Add explicit human escalation for high-risk or high-value workflows.

## Production Hardening Checklist

| Area | Recommended Upgrade |
| --- | --- |
| Authentication | Add Clerk, Auth.js, Supabase Auth, or your identity provider. |
| Authorization | Scope data and actions by user, team, tenant, or workspace. |
| Persistence | Store conversations, runs, documents, or generated assets in a database. |
| Observability | Add structured logs, traces, latency metrics, and error capture. |
| Cost Controls | Add request quotas, model allowlists, token budgets, and abuse monitoring. |
| Safety | Add input validation, output review, and domain-specific guardrails. |
| Deployment | Configure production environment variables in Vercel or your hosting platform. |

## Security Notes

- Never expose provider keys in browser components.
- Do not commit `.env.local`.
- Validate request bodies before calling model APIs.
- Add rate limits before allowing public traffic.
- Review logs for sensitive data before storing prompts or responses.

## Extension Ideas

- Add streaming responses.
- Add durable run history.
- Add workspace-level settings.
- Add file upload or retrieval where appropriate.
- Add structured JSON output schemas.
- Add evaluation fixtures for critical user journeys.
